# 100days100scripts
I've challenged myself to code more and better. The idea is to write minimum 1 piece of code daily.<br>
It's not about big, complex projects but a way to keep myself curious and motivated. Fingers crossed!

Day1 - Fibonacci sequence
<br>
Day2 - Bubble sort algorithm
<br>
Day3 - Collatz sequence (recursion)
<br>
Day4 - Simple calculator function
<br>
Day5 - Web scraper
