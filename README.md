# 100days100scripts
I've challenged myself to code more and better. The idea is to write minimum 1 piece of code daily.<br>
It's not about big, complex projects but a way to keep myself curious and motivated. Fingers crossed!

Day1 - [fibonacci] Fibonacci sequence
<br>
Day2 - [bubbleSort] Bubble sort algorithm
<br>
Day3 - [collatz] Collatz sequence (recursion)
<br>
Day4 - [simpleCalc] Simple calculator function
